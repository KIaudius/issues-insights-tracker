# Potential Challenges and Mitigations

This document outlines the anticipated challenges in developing and deploying the Issues & Insights Tracker application, along with strategies to mitigate them.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### Challenges
- Implementing secure OAuth2 with PKCE flow correctly
- Maintaining strict RBAC across all endpoints and WebSocket connections
- Handling token refresh and secure storage on the client side

### Mitigations
- Use well-tested libraries for OAuth2 implementation (authlib for backend, auth.js for frontend)
- Create comprehensive test cases for all permission scenarios
- Implement centralized permission checking in CRUD operations
- Use HTTP-only cookies for token storage where possible
- Implement automatic token refresh in the frontend

## 2. Real-Time Updates with WebSockets

### Challenges
- Managing WebSocket connections and reconnection scenarios
- Ensuring proper authentication for WebSocket connections
- Handling race conditions between REST API and WebSocket updates

### Mitigations
- Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Use JWT tokens for WebSocket authentication
- Implement optimistic UI updates with server confirmation
- Add sequence numbers or timestamps to messages to handle ordering

## 3. File Upload and Storage

### Challenges
- Securing file uploads against malicious content
- Managing disk space for uploaded files
- Ensuring efficient file delivery

### Mitigations
- Implement strict validation of file types, sizes, and content
- Use virus scanning for uploaded files (optional)
- Implement cleanup jobs for deleted issues and their attachments
- Consider using content delivery networks for production deployments

## 4. Database Performance

### Challenges
- Query performance as the database grows
- Managing database migrations in production
- Handling concurrent writes

### Mitigations
- Create appropriate indexes for common query patterns
- Use pagination for all list endpoints
- Test migrations thoroughly before applying to production
- Implement database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for scaling read operations

## 5. Background Jobs

### Challenges
- Ensuring background jobs run reliably
- Handling job failures and retries
- Monitoring job execution

### Mitigations
- Use a reliable scheduler (APScheduler) with persistent job store
- Implement job status tracking and error logging
- Add monitoring and alerting for failed jobs
- Implement idempotent job processing where possible

## 6. Frontend Performance

### Challenges
- Initial load performance
- Managing state across components
- Responsive design for various devices

### Mitigations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for initial page loads
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and compression
- Use responsive design patterns and test on multiple device sizes

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Challenges
- Achieving high test coverage (â‰¥80%)
- Testing WebSocket functionality
- Creating reliable E2E tests

### Mitigations
- Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach for critical components
- Create mock WebSocket server for testing
- Use stable selectors for E2E tests to prevent flakiness
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## 8. Deployment and DevOps

### Challenges
- Ensuring smooth deployment process
- Managing environment variables and secrets
- Monitoring application health

### Mitigations
- Use Docker Compose for consistent deployment
- Implement infrastructure as code for cloud deployments
- Use secrets management tools for sensitive information
- Implement health check endpoints and monitoring

## 9. Security Concerns

### Challenges
- Protecting against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Securing API endpoints
- Preventing data leakage

### Mitigations
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Use CSRF tokens for form submissions
- Sanitize user input, especially Markdown content
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Conduct security code reviews

## 10. User Experience

### Challenges
- Creating an intuitive UI for different user roles
- Handling error states gracefully
- Providing helpful feedback for user actions

### Mitigations
- Conduct usability testing with representative users
- Implement consistent error handling and user feedback
- Create role-specific dashboards and views
- Provide inline help and tooltips for complex features

## 11. Scalability

### Challenges
- Handling increased load as user base grows
- Managing WebSocket connections at scale
- Database scaling

### Mitigations
- Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- Implement connection limits and load balancing for WebSockets
- Use database sharding or read replicas for scaling
- Consider caching frequently accessed data

## 12. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

### Challenges
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation
- Ensuring new team members can onboard quickly

### Mitigations
- Create and maintain ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI specifications
- Create a comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Document common workflows and troubleshooting steps
